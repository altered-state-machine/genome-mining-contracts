# Genome Mining - Energy Sources

Two types of energy sources are based on how energy is generated.

- Passive Energy
- Active Energy

## Passive Energy Sources

Passive sources generate energy due to past events, without needing explicit user interaction with the energy source when energy is generated.

### LBA Energy Tokenomics - _No-Gas LBA LP Token Staking RFC_

The only passive energy source we have at the moment is LBA energy. Users accumulate LBA Energy passively if they keep LP tokens in the LBA after the LBA unlock period. However, tampering with LBA LP tokens will forfeit any unused LBA Energy.

    We provide a virtual staking, that automatically (from the userâ€™s perspective) stakes LP tokens, as long as the user does not withdraw LP tokens from the LBA contract. The user does not have to pay any gas or take any action for the LP tokens to start staking.

## Active Energy Sources

Active energy sources generate energy as a result of staking an ERC-20 token or any asset that can generate energy. See [Staking](staking_uc.md)

### ASTO Energy

Generated by Staking ASTO

### ASTO/USDC LP Energy

Generated by Staking LP tokens from ASTO/USDC LP pool. (This generally yields a different energy rate than ASTO)
